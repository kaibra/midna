# Midna
Midna helps you to gather insights.  

The app is in an early stage. It is written in kotlin and angular.   
Makes use of [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)

Current ideas are: 
* to gather insights periodically 
* support multiple ways of writing insight-providers
* display the insights using angular
* provide helpful features + configuration
